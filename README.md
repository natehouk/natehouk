Hi, I'm Nate üëã

I'm an Italian-American mathematician, computer engineer, derivatives trader, entrepreneur, and music enthusiast.

I'm interested in computers, programming, machine learning, options, old electronics, eurorack, techno music, and traveling. I currently reside in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

In June 2023, I led my team from ideation to execution, winning first place at the Flow Traders AI Hackathon. My expertise in generative AI and prompt engineering fuels my passion for this field.

In 2015, I founded Epsilon Records, a boutique record label specializing in Techno, Acid, and Deep House. I also pioneered Beautiful Techno, a genre fusing techno's intensity with melodic, emotive, and atmospheric elements for an immersive experience. Check out our latest releases on Bandcamp!

From 2008 to 2015 I worked as a derivatives trader at several high-frequency trading firms including IMC Financial Markets and Wolverine Trading.

I did my bachelors at the University of Southern California where I graduated in 2008 summa cum laude with a 4.0 major GPA in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I worked as a teaching assistant for EE106 taught by Professor Mark Redekopp.

In 2006 I founded the USC Chapter of Engineers Without Borders and served as the President through 2008. The EWB-USC club is a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to improving lives through sustainable water and related engineering projects.

In Fall 2005 I won the USC Programming Contest writing my solutions in C++. My EE459 senior design project involved writing embedded C and reverse engineering the Apple 30-pin connector to build an alarm clock called iSnooze.

I grew up on Bainbridge Island, WA and graduated from Bainbridge High School in 2004.
