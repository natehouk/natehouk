I did my bachelors at the University of Southern California where I graduated in 2008 summa cum laude with a 4.0 major GPA in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I worked as a teaching assisant for EE106 taught by Professor Mark Redekopp.

In Fall 2005 I won the USC Programming Contest writing my solutions in C++. My EE459 senior design project involved writing embedded C and reverse engineering the Apple 30-pin connector to build an alarm clock called iSnooze.

In 2006 I founded the USC Chapter of Engineers Without Borders and served as the President through 2008. The EWB-USC club is a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to improving lives through sustainable water and related engineering projects.

I grew up on Bainbridge Island, WA and graduated from Bainbridge High School in 2004.
